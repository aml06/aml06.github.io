          <h2>A Brief Examination of a Carbon Capture and Sequestration Possibility</h2>
          <br>
          <p>I have been working on a prototype system for carbon capture relying upon electrolysis in seawater to capture carbon as the
            solid mineral precipate Calcium Carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). This is a side reaction and generally regarded as an annoyance for electrolysis, sapping energy and reducing the efficiency of hydrogen evolution. Analysis indicates this is a financially
            viable way to mineralize carbon dioxide and attack the problem of climate change not just through avoiding emissions, but cleaning up past emissions. You are simultaneously mineralizing carbon while producing hydrogen which can then
            subsequently be used to power turbines or fuel cells and at large scale produce water. I had been aware of the principles of the chemistry but a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561">paper in 2021</a> really solidified my interest in a material science M.S. to ascertain the technical and economic viability of such a pathway.

          <p>The cost of solar power has shrunk enormously and likely will continue to plummet. This currently results in a surplus of power at noon (peak solar irradiance) and the problem of arbitraging this power from peak production to peak demand. This results in what is
            known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve">"duck curve"</a>. This problem will likely get worse as the price of solar cells <b><u>appears</u></b> to be dropping at a <a href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/news/information/information-detail/article/plummeting-prices-for-solar-power-and-storage-make-global-climate-transition-cheaper-than-expected.html">faster rate than battery storage</a>. Solar production
            will still need to always signficantly outpace battery deployment in order to account for solar's more limited capacity factor.

          <p>The California electrical grid has struggled to absorb the increasing solar input. The amount of renewable power (especially solar) curtailed each year has grown.</p>

          <p>The price of electricity at certain nodes can vary quite dramatically over the course of a day, going completely negative at certain times of the year, particularly the spring when cooling demands are still low and production is high.</p>

          <p>An arbitrage opportunity exists which current expansion in grid scale storage is striving to meet but the rate of solar growth is likely to <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/bloombergnef-already-cheaper-to-install-new-build-battery-storage-than-peaking-plants/">exceed battery capacity</a> for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <div class="block">
          <h2></h2>
          <p>So what should one do with this excess energy? Pursue a method that captures the arbitrage opportunity and mitigates climate change as a result of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
            In the interest of brevity I will spare a discussion of the state of global warming and its urgency. I suspect this (2024) summer will impress that upon us all but if not this summer, future summers assuredly will.
          A side reaction of seawater electrolysis is the production of metal carbonates, Calcium Carbonate in particular, which are insoluble in water and stable at ocean pH levels.</p>
          <p>CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></p>
          <p>H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></p>
          <p>HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></p>
          <p>CaCO<sub>3</sub> ⇌ Ca<sup>2+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></p>
          <p>(log K<sub>sp</sub> = -8.48 at 25 C⁰)</p>
          <p>This reaction proceeds forward or reverse dependent on the pH of the solution. In the alkaline environment around the cathode, the metal carbonates will precipitate out as a solid and can either be utilized or returned to the ocean at a point of erosion or collected and dispersed later in deeper water.
            The carbon in the solid carbonate has been removed from the sea-atmospheric system, removing and storing a carbon dioxide in one operation.

          <p>Electrolysis is performed on seawater during mid-day periods of low electricity prices with the resultant carbon depleted seawater returned to the ocean. The hydrogen from the operation is captured and later used to
            power a fuel cell during periods of high electrical prices resulting in an arbitrage of electricity. Depending on the design of electrode, chlorine or oxygen is generated at the anode. Chlorine can be captured and sold but scaling of the
            system will exceed industrial demand for chlorine and so will require chlorine evolution reaction (CER) suppressing anodes eventually.

        <div class = "block">
          <h2></h2>
          <p>CER suppressing anodes exist but are currently (to my knowledge) not pursued due to low efficiency production in seawater electrolysis (due to competing side reactions). These side reactions are beneficial in this design so relative hydrogen
            production inefficiency is not an issue.

          <p>The above image is a CER suppressing anode after 24-hours. There is an engineering challenge of capillary action interfering with the hydroxide layer at the water line resulting in the anode dissolving at the water-air interface
            but the bulk of the anode in the water is in good condition after 24-hours. This anode was fabricated based on work by <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1900556116">Kuang et al. 
            </a>
            but will
              require some further work and prototyping. This is essentially the chloro-alkali process as well, conducted at a higher pH so chlorine evolution could be captured and sold which would allow the use of established
              platinum anodes. This would be more complicated from a prototype construction perspective and would only scale to a few millions tons per year (once you've saturated the chlorine market) so I 
              prefer to pursue the CER suppressing anode design.

            A conservative estimate of costs to construct a 4,000 ton CO<sub>2</sub> per year sequestration system (electrolyzer, fuel cells, storage, facilities, electricity, etc.) had an estimated breakeven priuce of between $250 and $550 per ton CO<sub>2</sub> mineralized. This is well below current market prices.

          <p class = "citation-link">Source: Andrew Lyon</p>
          <p>I suspect that sub $50 a ton is very possible when built at scale. At $50 a ton, the 36 billion tons of global yearly emissions would cost $1.8 trillion to fully mineralize.
            The cost of mineralizing the emissions of a gallon of gas would be 50-70 cents. I am fully convinced that industrial scale carbon capture is not just viable, it is inevitable. In a region with large amounts of solar energy and access to the ocean, excess electrical generation
          goes to mineralization and produced hydrogen could be used at night or as a peaker plant. Large scale use of hydrogen as a fuel will also produce capturable water (approximately 1 acre-foot per 4,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> mineralized according to my calculation). This is not
          competitive with desalination as a water "source" neccesarily but hydrogen gas could be transported (I believe although I have not thoroughly researched this point) more easily than desalinated water over large distances (and especially to higher elevations).</p>

        <p>Who would pay for this at the start though? Anyone with money and either climate concerns or a reputation to protect. Specifically: celebrities. Bill Gates is leading the way and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/25/from-bill-gates-to-the-pope-talk-of-carbon-capture-is-dividing-society.html">supporting Climeworks</a>
        but there are a lot of celebrities that fly private jets and at the start, carbon mineralization can be a means of brand and reputation protection. I believe this is a very viable market.</p>
      </div>
        <div class = "block">
          <p>So what do I do next? I have been looking for a lab/company in the Los Angeles / Las Vegas areas to fabricate a larger anode and build a prototype system capable of mineralizing an appreciable amount in an hour (100g or so).
            I still need some experimentation on the prototype to thoroughly block the capillary action from breaking the protective layer. I have been trying to find a lab or company that can assist but so far, not really any interest. I have pondered 
            sourcing parts and I think there is a lot of space for clever application of neglected materials: for example, used Toyota Mirais are selling at a discount and have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Mirai">100+ kW power output</a> with a seeming supply of 100+ cars for $6000-$7000.
            My more formal analaysis using NREL/PNNL referenced materials assumed a price of <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/media/file/Hydrogen_Methodology.pdf">$1,387 per kW for fuel cells</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I think a small carbon mineralization / hydrogen fuel cell powered peaker plant with capturable, sustainably sourced water that could be sold at a premium is a financially viable idea and worthy of exploration. But getting from
            nothing to something is the challenge and is what I am still working to surmount.
